#Introduction

Sorting is arranging the elements in a list or collection in increasing or decreasing
order of some property. 

    I.e: Sort by order of `value`, sort by order of factor..


##Classification:

We have so many algorithms for sorting that have been design over a period of time:
- Bubble sort
- Selection sort
- Insertion sort
- Merge sort
- Quick sort
- Heap sort
- Counting sort
- Radix sort

We often classify sorting alogirhms based on some parameters: 

1. Time Complexity: 
The measure of rate of growth of time taken by an algorithm with respect to input size.	Some algorithm will be relatively faster than others.
	
2. Space Complexity/ Memory usage
- In-place memory:
Some algorihtm are in-place, they use constant amount of memory to rearrange the elements in the list.  
- External memory:


 3. Stability
